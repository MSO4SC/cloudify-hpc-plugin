ifdef::status[]
image:https://img.shields.io/travis/MSO4SC/cloudify-hpc-plugin/master.svg[Build Status (Travis CI), link={uri-ci-travis}]
endif::[]

A HPC plugin for {uri-cloudify}[Cloudify] that enables it to manage HPC resources in one or more infrastructures. The currently supported resource types are described below.

This plugin is part of the {uri-mso4sc}[MSO4SC H2020 European Project].

TIP: Example blueprints can be found at the {uri-blueprint-examples}[MSO4SC resources repository].

toc::[]


== Overview

The plugin aims to enable {uri-cloudify}[Cloudify] to manage HPC resources, so at the end, combined with other plugins, it can orchestrate a hybrid cloud+hpc environment, with one or more cloud and hpc providerds at the same time.

It adds a new resource type, <<hpc.nodes.Compute>>, that represents a HPC infrastructure, and <<hpc.nodes.job>> and <<hpc.nodes.singularity_job>>, that represents a job in the HPC and a job using a {uri-singularity}[Singularity] container respectively.

In order to Cloudify orchestrates properly the HPC resources, the help of an external monitor system is needed, from which the job status is retrieved. In the next release the plugin will also use the monitor to predict the overall state of the HPC and take best decisions about which partition and infrastructure to use for each job.

IMPORTANT: Only {uri-slurm}[Slurm] based HPCs are supported for now as well as only {uri-prometheus}[Prometheus] is supported as monitoring system.



== Plugin Requirements

* Python version 2.7.x
* Access to at least a {uri-slurm}[Slurm] based HPC by ssh user & password.
* {uri-prometheus}[Prometheus] monitoring the infrastructures to be used ({uri-slurm-exporter}[Slurm exporter] has been developed for this purpose)

=== Optional:

* The {uri-monitor-orchestrator}[Monitor Orchestrator] can be deployed in the same host as the monitor to allow the plugin to dynamically use new HPC infrastructures defined in TOSCA.
* {uri-grafana}[Grafana] can be used to visualize the status of the HPCs.


== Installation & Usage

The plugin is installed as any other plugin. Check {uri-cloudify-docs}[Cloudify Docs] for general information about how to install and use Cloudify, and {uri-cloudify-use-plugin}[this section] for concrete information about using plugins.

Additionally {uri-mso4sc}[MSO4SC] provide {uri-vagrant}[Vagrant] and {uri-docker}[Docker] images at {uri-mso4sc-dockerhub}[Docker Hub] to install everything. *Check {uri-msoorchestrator-cli}[MSOOrchestrator-CLI] to start using Cloudify CLI and bootstrap the Cloudify Manager. Use {uri-monitor-compose}[docker compose file] to deploy all the external components. A {uri-grafana}[Grafana] dashboard can be found {uri-grafana-mso4sc-dashboard}[here].*

== HPC Plugin Configuration

The HPC plugin requires credentials, endpoint and other setup information in order to authenticate and interact with them.

=== Providing Credentials as Secrets

WARNING: Not yet implemented

[[hpc-config-properties]]
=== Providing Credentials as Environment Variables that are not Stored as Secrets

If you do not use secret storage, you must provide the following credentials as properties (in the blueprint or as input):

[source,yaml]
----
HPC_config:
    credentials:
        host: "[HPC-HOST]"
        user: "[HPC-SSH-USER]"
        password: "[HPC-SSH-PASS]"
    country_tz: "Europe/Madrid"
    workload_manager: "SLURM"
----

This configuration properties are passed then to <<hpc.nodes.Compute>> config properties.

. _credentials_: HPC and ssh credentials
. _country_tz_: Country Time Zone configured in the the HPC.
. _workload_manager_: Workload manager used by the HPC.

WARNING: Only Slurm is currently accepted as workload manager.

== Types

This section describes the {uri-cloudify-types}[node type] definitions. Nodes describe resources in your HPC infrastructures. For more information, see {uri-cloudify-types}[node type].

=== hpc.nodes.Compute

**Derived From:** {uri-cloudify-builtin-types}[cloudify.nodes.Compute]

Use this type to describe a HPC infrastructure.

**Properties:**

* `config`: HPC configuration, as described in <<hpc-config-properties>>.
* `external_monitor_entrypoint`: Entrypoint of the external monitor that Cloudify will use instead of the internal one.
* `external_monitor_port`: Port of the monitor. Default `:9090`.
* `external_monitor_type`: Specific monitor tool. Default `{uri-prometheus}[PROMETHEUS]`.
* `external_monitor_orchestrator_port`: Monitor orchestrator port. Default `:8079`.
* `job_prefix`: Job name prefix for the jobs created in this HPC. Default `cfyhpc`.
* `base_dir`: Root directory in which to run the executions in this ifrastructure. Default `$HOME`.
* `workdir_prefix`: Prefix name of the working directory that will be created for this infrastructure.
* `skip_cleanup`: True to not clean all files when destroying the deployment. Default `False`.
* `simulate`: If true, don't send the jobs to the HPC and simulate that they finish inmediately. Useful for test new TOSCA files. Default `False`.

*Example*

This example demonstrates how to add a new HPC.

** `inputs`: List of inputs that will be passed to the scripts when executed in the HPC.
* `skip_cleanup`: Set to true to not clean up orchestrator auxiliar files. Default `False`.

NOTE: The variable $CURRENT_WORKDIR is available in all operations and scripts. It points to the working directory of the execution in the HPC from the _HOME_ directory: `/home/user/$CURRENT_WORKDIR/`.

* `hpc.interfaces.lifecycle.cancel` Cancels a queued job.



== Relationships

See the {uri-cloudify-relationships}[relationships] section.

The following plugin relationship operations are defined in the HPC plugin:

* `job_contained_in_hpc` Sets a <<hpc.nodes.Compute>> to be executed inside the target HPC.

* `job_depends_on` Sets a <<hpc.nodes.Compute>> as a dependency of the target, so the target job needs to finish before the source can start.


== Tests

To run the tests Cloudify CLI has to be installed locally. Example blueprints can be found at _tests/blueprint_ folder and have the `simulate` option active by default. Blueprint to be tested can be changed at _workflows_tests.py_ in the _tests_ folder.

To run the tests against a real HPC / Monitor system, copy the file _blueprint-inputs.yaml_ to _local-blueprint-inputs.yaml_ and edit with your credentials. Then edit the blueprint commenting the simulate option, and other parameters as you wish (e.g change the name ft2_node for your own hpc name).

[NOTE]
==========================
_dev-requirements.txt_ needs to be installed (_windev-requirements.txt_ for windows):
[source,bash]
----
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
